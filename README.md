# Marvin.OS development Guide

This repository is a tutorial-series of x86 Operating System development. This tutorial aims at a wide audiance, including people with little knowledge about C programming.

**Prerequsites** :
This tutorial assumes the reader has basic knowledge about computer programming and basic understanding of Compilers, a basic knowledge of existing operating systems is a plus. So, here are the basic software tools you require to kick-start a simple operating system kernel : 

 * **Any Linux based operating system like Ubuntu** - Development of an application is simple with Linux based distros because it comes with wide range of programming and compiler tool-chains required for development, it is also easier to install and configure a new toolchain, if necessary. To build an Operating system, **GCC** is more than enough. See more about GCC toolchain if you are a newbie.
 * **Emulator (QEMU)** : Emulator is a software that emulates something. To give a sense of a what exactly is an emulator, let me take this example, we all have played android games on our desktop or laptops, am I right ? It is nothing but emulation. It can sometimes be really scary to test our Operating System directly on Hardware, so we use emulator like **QEMU**. QEMU is easy to use and light-weight.
 * **A 32 bit Machine** : This is required if you want to test your OS on bare metal hardware. 32 bit machines are also supported on 64 bit machines, means , any modren laptop can run our Operating System without any issues.
 

Hope you enjoy the tutorial
